### Let's see how it works!


---

# Running the program

### Start the program via the command line:  `python grocery_list.py`

### A welcome message appears:
```{r fig_intro, echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}

knitr::include_graphics('img/intro.png')

```

---

# Entering list items

.pull-left[


### When prompted, enter each item you wish to buy, one at a time


- A current limitation of the program is that the user must enter a **singular nouns**
- Behind the scenes, the program is trying to identify the item in its database
- The program will prompt to correct the entry if the item is not found

### After each item, the program will prompts you for a quantity

- Quantity must be convertable to an integer, otherwise the program will prompt for another quantity

]

.pull-right[
<center>
```{r fig_entry, echo = FALSE, out.width = 350}

knitr::include_graphics('img/entry.png')

```
</center>
]


---

# The grocery list

.pull-left[
### Once you enter all list item, the program displays a grocery list

- The list is organized by category
- Contains all inputted items and quantities

### The list is displayed in the console

- Can be easily copied to list management software of choice
]

.pull-right[
<center>
```{r fig_list_text, echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}

knitr::include_graphics('img/list_text_cropped.png')

```
</center>
]

---
# The grocery list

.pull-left[
### The list is also saved as a `.png` image

- Dimensions scaled for a smartphone
- Current date included
- Can be emailed or shared to the cloud
- Saved to the `lists/` subdirectory in the same folder as the program

<br>

```{r fig_list_loc, echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}

knitr::include_graphics('img/list_image_loc.png')

```

]

.pull-right[
<center>
```{r fig_list_image, echo = FALSE, out.width = 350}

knitr::include_graphics('img/grocery_list_2021-05-26_cropped.png')

```
</center>
]


---
# How it works

.pull-left[
### User inputs are checked against a dictionary of food items, created from `.csv` files

- At the start of the program, these `.csv` files are read into a single dictionary, with keys as categories and values as lists of foods

### The food dictionary is used to organize inputs according to category

### The `.png` image is created by "drawing" text on a blank image

]

.pull-right[
<center>
<br>
```{r fig_database, echo = FALSE, out.width = 250}

knitr::include_graphics('img/database.png')

```
</center>
]


---
# Customization

### Food items in the database can be added to relevant `.csv` files in the `data/` subdirectory

### List image dimensions can be customized by updating two lines in the program code:

```{python customization_dims, echo = TRUE}
# image dimensions
# (currently set for iphone 6)
IMAGE_WIDTH = 750
IMAGE_HEIGHT = 1334
```

### Font family used in the list image can be customized via files in the `utils/` subdirectory:

```{python customization_font, echo = TRUE}
# files containing fonts
# (light font will be used for date & items)
# (bold font will be used for title & section headings)
FONTFILE_LIGHT = 'utils/Roboto-Light.ttf'
FONTFILE_BOLD = 'utils/Roboto-Bold.ttf'
```
